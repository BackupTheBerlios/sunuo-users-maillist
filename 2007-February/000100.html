<PRE>Hi everyone,

 

I just signed up for this mailing list recently.  I have installed sunuo on
my server that I have on co-location in New York.  I also sell IRCD, bnc,
etc. but this shard will be the only game on the server.

 

I haven't played UO in years.  I sold my account years ago when the scrolls
first came out.  I am trying to get this shard working with evos and some
other things that I like from the free shards I have seen lately.

 

I guess I am wondering if there is more documentation about sunuo somewhere.
Or does anyone here have a good location of some of the better scripts that
work with sunuo.  I tried to install an evos script that I can't make work
to save my life.  

 

Anyway, would someone volunteer to let me come see their shard that is
running sunuo?  Maybe see what some of the scripts do?  

 

I am a single Mom and I work full time, I don't really have a lot of time to
devote to this.  I was also hoping to find someone who might be interested
in helping me with it.

 

I am totally open to suggestions here.  I did meet a guy from uogateway
forums that wants to help me.  Is there any way he could get me in trouble
if he had admin access to the shard?  I mean I can always reinstall in a new
directory so if he messed up the shard it's no big deal.  Being as new to
this as I am, I don't know what to look out for.  This guy is way too
interested in helping me and mentioned the people from uogateway didn't like
him.  

 

Anyway, have a great day!!  It's Valentines Day :) 

 

Cabernay / Tonya
