Subject: [sunuo-users] SunUO 0.3.0 is released!
Message-ID: <20060205202435.GA9072@roonstrasse.net>

Hi,

today, the SunUO project celebrates its first birthday. On February
2nd, 2005, SunUO 0.1.0 was released.  Today, I sent the 500th commit
to the subversion repository (generously hosted by BerliOS) which
happens to be the release of version 0.3.0.

Major changes:

- optimized memory usage, mostly by lazy allocation
- less CPU usage and lower latency by using mutexes instead of a fixed
- sleep time
- 64 bit support (.NET 2.0) - the binary release now includes a .EXE
  for Windows x64
