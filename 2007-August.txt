Any dependency you need for legacy scripts, have to be in legacy folder.
The split into libraries option is only useful for independent packages,
like UOArchitect, which you use and this will work.

As said, just put the scripts on which the legacy scripts depend to the
other legacy scripts. sunuo is able to solve dependencies by it self, if
they are in the same location.

Thanks for your answer. I already tried to put the TransferServer.dll into the Assemblies.cfg. But this brings up the same problem. I think this precompiled dll isn't compatible with mono.
I already ask ArteGordon (the maker of SpawnEditor) to release his source. He is willing todo it after a source cleanup.

The second sollution solves my problems. I thought, that sunuo is able to solve dependencies with the libraries option in comparsion with overlay scripts. This would be the more clean sollution i think.
But now it works for now. Thanks much.

regards

SiENcE

So is TransferServer.dll a CIL binary, or is it a native (i.e. Win32)
binary?  I am unable to download it myself, because I am banned on
runuo.com.

Good.  I cannot (and will not even try to) provide support for closed
source libraries.  In fact, it is illegal to distribute precompiled
DLLs for SunUO without source.

No, the source for this seems to be available at
http://xmlspawner.15.forumer.com/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=2929

You can download it, its not runuo.

But I think, if you just compile the source of TransferServer with mono,
it should work. It seems to me, that Florian used the RunUO 2.0 dll
direct from archive.

Any chance of SunUO being updated to support 6.0.1.10 or later versions? I'd
help but I'm just a casual scripter.


Also, I realize there were mailing lists long before forums existed but why
haven't you guys moved to a forum? It seems a much easier medium to hold
discussions. Just curious :)

So is it just me and one other guy that still frequents this mailing list?
Is the development of SunUO still moving forward or should I look at
compiling runuo 2.0 under mono for my linux fix. I'm not trying to start a
flamewar sunuo vs runuo, just wondering if I should continue with this
project?

I don't understand your question. What is the problem with client
version 6.0.1.10 and sunuo?

Hello Admin,

there will be support for newer clients very soon.  Maik extracted a
patch from the RunUO 2.0 Subversion repository, which I will apply to
the SunUO sources this week.

There used to be a forum, which was closed for some reason, but I
don't care.  I still do not understand how people think that a web
based forum is better than a mailing list.  With mailing lists, I can
use my favorite mailer and my favorite message editor, but with a web
based solution, I'm heavily restricted.  If anyone feels there should
be a forum, then go ahead and create one.

Max

Thanks for looking into this guys. The attitudes here are so refreshing
after hanging out at "that other place" for a few years. Long live SunUO!

Max, Everyone,

I've created a forum at http://sunuo.freeforums.org/ if any of you would
like to take a look. I'll be happy to turn over administration of the forum
to Max or someone he designates if this takes off. I understand I may be in
the minority when it comes to mailing list vs forums so we can just see how
this plays out.

Hi all,

the new SunUO version supports the new UO client version 6.

 http://www.sunuo.org/download.html
 http://download.berlios.de/sunuo/sunuo-0.5.0.zip

The patch was pulled from RunUO's public subversion repository.  Many
thanks to the RunUO team for developing this patch.

Good to see that the Open Source principle works for us.  Last year,
Mark replaced RunUO's hard-coded 10ms sleep() invocation with SunUO's
tickless event-based system.

Max,

How are you my friend?

I've just updated to 0.5.0 and I'm having the following issue:

2007-08-22 09:56:48,641 ERROR System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: Connection
reset by peer
  at
System.Net.Sockets.Socket+SocketAsyncResult.CheckIfThrowDelayedException ()

  at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.EndReceive (IAsyncResult result) [0x00000]
  at Server.Network.NetState.OnReceive (IAsyncResult asyncResult) [0x00000]

I never had error like this...

Got any idea why it drops the client?

I'm also having lag problem...

runnning on Linux, kernel 2.6....

Thanks
