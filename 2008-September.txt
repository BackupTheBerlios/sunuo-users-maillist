Subject: [sunuo-users] Bug in Revision 898 -> 899
Message-ID: <48DBC0BE.4040408@nkey.de>

Hello list,

unfortunately there is a bug in the patch from Defiance. If we have a
multi-page gump like the account list gump or the .go gump the gump will
be removed after closing but the callback routine is not finished. This
will result in the behaviour, thats not possible to create new accounts
in the admin gump nor use the .go command.

If I comment the line 6201 in Mobile.cs, which should contain

m_NetState.RemoveGump(gump);

the .go gump works correctly, as well as the account list to create a
new account.

Best regards

Maik
