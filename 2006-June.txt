First, SunLogin:  What do I have to do to use (and configure)
SunLogin?  I know about setting ignore-auth-id in the config, but what
else I need to do?  Documentation pointers would be VERY welcome here
- the only info I was able to find is that it is able to use a
database for accounts (I want to use the DB-accounts support, since it
will make it easy to set up web-based account creation).

Second, Scripts:  This just in from Ryan:  RunUO's scripts are
licensed under the GPL (including scripts for RunUO 1.0, and
user-created scripts).  Read about it at http://www.runuo.com - It's
at the bottom of the main page, and also in the "Announcements" forum
(use your favorite proxy if you have to :) ).  And on that note,
should we start maintaining "Legacy" scripts for SunUO, including mods
to get them working on mono/linux?

Thanks

SunLogin was created for Defiance and uses their crappy database
format.  I suggest not to use it right now.  It was planned to change
their table structure, but this hasn't been done.

This is very good news.  I'll be on vacation for 2 weeks, let's talk
about that project after my return.  Please make a screenshot of that
statement, it may be important to archive it.

Ok.  I'll look into laying out a better format, then.  I really think
that running with "AutoAccounts" enabled is a bad idea, but I don't
really want to have to manually approve and create accounts.
Web-based account creation (with e-mail-based confirmation) seems, to
me, like the most reasonable alternative, and works best with a
database.

Screenshot taken.  I'm still too "new" at C# programming to be much
help on this front, but I'll do what I can.  Most of the work has
already been done, tho (the only exception I can think of being the
factions mess) - it just needs to be packaged.

Subject: [sunuo-users] Error during first startup.
Message-ID: <7cf8dd660606231806r60b94477w931a54c26a3d9839@mail.gmail.com>

I have an error that's been happening during Startup:
===
2006-06-23 17:57:23,546 FATAL failed to load item
System.Exception: ***** Bad serialize on Server.Items.WoodenChair *****
   at Server.World.LoadEntities() in c:\sunuo-0.3.1\src\World.cs:line 732
An error was encountered while loading a saved object
 - Type: Server.Items.WoodenChair
 - Serial: 0xFFFFFFFF
Delete the object? (y/n)
===
This is with SunUO on MS .NET 1.1 SP1.  The error also occurs using
Mono 1.1.13.6, and I get a different error (crash, and I didn't keep a
log) with Mono 1.1.15.  Both Mono tests are on Gentoo Linux (full ~x86
box, plus out-of-tree kernel, headers, and glibc - Mono 1.1.15 was
also installed from an overlay).

I am not familiar enough with C#, SunUO, or RunUO to have even the
slightest clue where to look for an answer to this problem.

Note:  Using the 32-bit .NET 2.0 SunUO.exe provided with
sunuo-0.3.1-bin did not help either.

Nothing has been modified, not even Zlib.cs this time (I usually fix
that one right off the top, but after about the third wipe/reinstall
of SunUO trying to figure this mess out I stopped doing it), and there
isn't a worldsave to be corrupt/broken yet (first startup, new shard).

crud...I just double-checked everything, and found that I had a
"Saves" folder in my SunUO folder - which didn't belong there.  Yanked
that, and everything now works, including a bunch of custom scripts I
was testing.  Thanks for the pointer in the right direction, and sorry
for wasting your time.

Subject: [sunuo-users] Cascaing Overlays
Message-ID: <7cf8dd660606260541x76dd614drd199baac943c945d@mail.gmail.com>

I attempted the following in SunUO:
<library name="legacy">
    <overlay name="owltr"/>
</library>
<library name="owltr">
    <overlay name="owltr-overrides"/>
</library>
<library name="owltr-overrides">
</library>

And got the following error starting SunUO:
ERROR: Can't overlay owltr which is being used as overlay for another library.

Hmmm...My question is this:  How hard would it be to implement this,
and is there a good reason it's not already been done?  Take the above
case in point - I have somebody else's custom script which needs to
overlay Legacy and, in order for it to coexist with other scripts I'm
planning on using for my server, I need to make modifications to that
script.  I think that this case should be handled gracefully, by
allowing me to overlay the overlay ("cascade" the 2 overlays), rather
than requiring me to modify the first overlay directly.  Any reason
this can't and/or shouldn't be done (other than SunUO not currently
allowing it, of course)?
