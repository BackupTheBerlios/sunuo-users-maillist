Please post the full error message (copy+paste).  Without it, we would
have to guess where the compile error occurs.

The code which was commented out is indeed invalid.  It's old code
from RunUO.  If you want to modify the maps, please edit the script
Misc/MapDefinitions.cs.

Subject: [sunuo-users] I just signed up for this mailing list and I have a
	few questions
Message-ID: <000a01c7507c$dea9b860$800101df@bearrivercasino.com>

Hi everyone,

 

I just signed up for this mailing list recently.  I have installed sunuo on
my server that I have on co-location in New York.  I also sell IRCD, bnc,
etc. but this shard will be the only game on the server.

 

I haven't played UO in years.  I sold my account years ago when the scrolls
first came out.  I am trying to get this shard working with evos and some
other things that I like from the free shards I have seen lately.

 

I guess I am wondering if there is more documentation about sunuo somewhere.
Or does anyone here have a good location of some of the better scripts that
work with sunuo.  I tried to install an evos script that I can't make work
to save my life.  

 

Anyway, would someone volunteer to let me come see their shard that is
running sunuo?  Maybe see what some of the scripts do?  

 

I am a single Mom and I work full time, I don't really have a lot of time to
devote to this.  I was also hoping to find someone who might be interested
in helping me with it.

 

I am totally open to suggestions here.  I did meet a guy from uogateway
forums that wants to help me.  Is there any way he could get me in trouble
if he had admin access to the shard?  I mean I can always reinstall in a new
directory so if he messed up the shard it's no big deal.  Being as new to
this as I am, I don't know what to look out for.  This guy is way too
interested in helping me and mentioned the people from uogateway didn't like
him.  

 

Anyway, have a great day!!  It's Valentines Day :) 

 

Cabernay / Tonya

I installed this script.
(http://www.runuo.com/forums/server-support/73115-xantos-evo-system-prob.htm

This is the error I am getting.  

 

I am really trying here.  Am I putting it in the wrong directory?  Does
anyone know what I am doing wrong here?

 

Thanks

Obviously, the code you downloaded contains invalid C# syntax.  Since
I have no access to the RunUO forum (I'm banned), I cannot help you
with that, sorry.

Well here is my dilemma.  This mail list seems to be my only means of
support/help with SunUO.

I don't mind using older versions of these scripts.

But at this time I have no idea where to find them.  

I am thinking about installing vmware and xp and then runuo.  I really
didn't want to do that, but at least I have somewhere to turn.

Do you know where I can find scripts that will work with sunuo?

Send me the xanthos evo sys per mail, not to this list, I will fix it
