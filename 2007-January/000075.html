Right, in this special case, the uo server never should know, that the
packet comes from outside the LAN. Because the source address of a
packet in direction to the server will get the routers internal address
(the nature of network address translation). This is the fact on which
my meaning that 0.0.0.0 listens on any address :-)

&gt;<i> Ok, now a basic introduction to the UO protocol, maybe this helps you

Yes, yesterday I did some investigations and Core.Config.GameServers
should do the trick. On RunUO I had to fix the Address to my DynDNS name
to make it work. In the sunuo sources, which I want to take from now on
there is no

public const string Address

in Misc/ServerList.cs. So I'm confused. There was no description how to
put more servers in the GameServer configuration. I tested some things
with the &lt;bind....&gt; configuration option in sunuo.xml, without success.

BTW; If I write a dns name instead of an IP address into the
configuration, the server doesn't start because of invalid ip address.
May you can fix this by adding a simple dns name resolution? Would be
very nice. May I can do this job for you, I can program C#, too.

BTW2: Do you have a todo-list? May I can help you with such things?

&gt;<i> This is where it becomes interesting: which IP did the login server
</I>&gt;<i> send?  Its own?  That is, 192.168.2.100.  Now your brother's client
</I>&gt;<i> connects to 192.168.2.100.  But that doesn't work since 192.168.2.100
</I>&gt;<i> is a private IP.
</I>
Obviously the server sends its local LAN address, because it can't know
something about the external address, if I don't tell it...

&gt;<i> What you have to do is make SunUO send the &quot;official&quot; DSL IP.
</I>
Yes, but how?

&gt;<i> One solution would be to edit the &quot;Address&quot; variable and enter your
</I>&gt;<i> DynDNS hostname there.  Which Misc/ServerList.cs are you using,
</I>&gt;<i> RunUO's or SunUO's?
</I>
See above. We did make a complete clean up and use now the whole sunuo
scripts and core.
