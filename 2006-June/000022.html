</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, SunLogin:  What do I have to do to use (and configure)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SunLogin?  I know about setting ignore-auth-id in the config, but what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; else I need to do?  Documentation pointers would be VERY welcome here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the only info I was able to find is that it is able to use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; database for accounts (I want to use the DB-accounts support, since it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will make it easy to set up web-based account creation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SunLogin was created for Defiance and uses their crappy database
</I>&gt;<i> format.  I suggest not to use it right now.  It was planned to change
</I>&gt;<i> their table structure, but this hasn't been done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok.  I'll look into laying out a better format, then.  I really think
that running with &quot;AutoAccounts&quot; enabled is a bad idea, but I don't
really want to have to manually approve and create accounts.
Web-based account creation (with e-mail-based confirmation) seems, to
me, like the most reasonable alternative, and works best with a
database.

&gt;<i> &gt; Second, Scripts: This just in from Ryan: RunUO's scripts are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensed under the GPL (including scripts for RunUO 1.0, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user-created scripts).  Read about it at <A HREF="http://www.runuo.com">http://www.runuo.com</A> - It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the bottom of the main page, and also in the &quot;Announcements&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forum (use your favorite proxy if you have to :) ).  And on that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; note, should we start maintaining &quot;Legacy&quot; scripts for SunUO,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including mods to get them working on mono/linux?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is very good news.  I'll be on vacation for 2 weeks, let's talk
</I>&gt;<i> about that project after my return.  Please make a screenshot of that
</I>&gt;<i> statement, it may be important to archive it.
</I>Screenshot taken.  I'm still too &quot;new&quot; at C# programming to be much
help on this front, but I'll do what I can.  Most of the work has
already been done, tho (the only exception I can think of being the
factions mess) - it just needs to be packaged.
