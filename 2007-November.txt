Greetings

 

I am experiencing some problems getting started.  First, I downloaded
and installed the UO client (Mondain's Legacy, I think was the version
name) from FilePlanet, but when I started it to patch the client up, the
patcher choked when it tried to apply the first patch, and quit with an
error message saying that I might not be using a valid client.  What
client should I be using?

 

I also have a question about editing the ./etc/sunuo.xml file.  The
example in the documentation seems to presume a Linux system for the
data-path example (<data-path>/usr/local/games/uo</data-path>), but I am
running a Windows XP system.  I entered something like
<data-path>c:/Program Files/uo</data-path>.  SunUO didn't barf when I
launched it, but neither did it find the client when I started it and
tried to enter a user name and password.  In the client, the message I
got seemed to indicate that it tried and failed to log into the regular
game.
 
Perhaps this is because I am not using a valid client, either because I
have the wrong client, or perhaps because the client I have failed to
patch, but if there is some other configuration step I should be
performing, or if I have screwed up the <data-path> declaration, it
isn't obvious from your documentation.
 
Since SunUO supports both Windows and Linux, it would be helpful to
provide example for both platforms in the documentation.
 
Thanks
 
Owain

SunUO is not involved in patching the UO client, so I'm sorry I cannot
help with that.  It's important however to disable encryption before
you try to log in to SunUO.

I believe the slash '/' is not a valid path separator on windows,
i.e. the path you entered might be invalid.  If you experience errors,
please provide all relevant error messages.

Good idea, I will add an example path for windows.
