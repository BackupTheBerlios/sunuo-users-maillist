ok i considered it's a good time to make this post.
i already work with sunuo at my linux box and run a shard with it.
i also uses linux as my desktop OS and develop using it.
what i want to know is:

what you people have tested about runuo 2.0 and incompatibilities with
current mono implementation of net framework 2.0.

the first thing that i saw was about generic collections, but mono
1.1.16seens to solve this issue. my ubuntu doesn't support it and i
think i wil
have to way a beta version of next release (edgy) to try it as it has many
incompatibilities that prevent running it on dapper.

does any one already testes it with mono 1.1.16 ?

Well, it doesn't work with mono 1.1.16 (I tried it, also tried
1.1.17).  It may work with 1.1.18 or later, but I don't know.  In any
case, RunUO 2.0 uses a number of features of the .NET 2.0 class
libraries, which may or may not be implemented in mono.  So how about
trying it with the latest mono and seeing what happens?  I'm going to
be trying again soon myself, too.  Hope this helps.

You're getting errors in collection.generics?  Are you using mcs to
attempt to compile RunUO 2.0?  If so, keep in mind that mcs doesn't
support generics, you'll need to use gmcs instead.

As for backporting other features, I don't think we should backport
any feature to .NET 1.0 unless a) gmcs doesn't support it (and it's
not trivial to implement) and b) backporting the feature doesn't cause
any breakage in existing scripts.  This is to keep compatibility with
"legacy" scripts - a feature of SunUO that I'd rather not part with.

Here's hoping that mono can run RunUO 2.0 soon. :)
